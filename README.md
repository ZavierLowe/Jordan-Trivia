# Unsolved Problems 
For having feed back for users I wanted to implement a sound where clicking on the wrogn answer goes plays a sound of missing a basket and if they got it right, it plays a swish sound.

# Major Hurdles
Creating the game logic to move on to the next quesiton was hard. It may be minor but I had to make sure my answers and questions in the array had no extra spaces which would break my logic with each quesiton for the game.
